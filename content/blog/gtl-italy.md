<!-- # This is the description -->
Over winter break I taught physics in Pordenone, Italy through MITâ€™s GTL program.

Classes had 15-25 students with various levels of English-speaking ability. While teaching was primarily done in English, I also used my Spanish and Italian when students struggled to understand a concept.

I taught the following classes:

- Algebra-Based Mechanics (2)
- Heat Transfer (2)
- Circuits
- Electricity & Magnetism
- Intro to Web Development with HTML and CSS
- Machine Learning

I was responsible for developing small problem sets that engaged student content.

I particularly appreciated this opportunity because of the ability to return to Italy. I lived there when I was younger, but now had the opportunity to do so as a host. It was an invaluable opportunity to learn more about Italian culture and myself.
