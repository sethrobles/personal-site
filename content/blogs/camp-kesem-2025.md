This past week, I had the opportunity to be at [Camp Kesem website](https://www.campkesem.org/), a week-long summer camp for kids whose parents have been affected by cancer.

<h2 style="text-align:center;">Highlights from the Week</h2>

There were a few moments that really made the week special:

- **Camp Conversations**: Whether it was arguing over someone's crazy basketball GOAT takes or convincing 14-year old campers to take showers, these little moments brought camper sand counselors close together.
- **Color Olympics**: A longer event with a mix of fun games, colorful chants, and a LOT of yelling (see below).
- **Affirmations and Empowerment**: More vulnerable moments where campers and counselors are able to show who they are.
