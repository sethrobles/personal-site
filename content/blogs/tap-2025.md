# Spring Break 2025

This Spring Break, I decided to visit home, since I had been home so little for winter break and the past summer. I found out about MIT's Travel Access Program, where students can go to high schools in their home area and talk about MIT.

While I was there, I had the opportunity to talk about my experience at MIT as a first-generation student in college. I was also able to talk about other programs, including the [Jack Kent Cooke Scholarship](https://www.jkcf.org/our-scholarships/), the [Gates Scholarship](https://www.thegatesscholarship.org/scholarship), and [MITES](https://mites.mit.edu/).

It was an exciting opportunity to give back to the community in Clarksville and share more about my MIT experience with others.
