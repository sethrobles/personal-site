# Teaching Physics at MITES

This summer I had the chance to serve as a **Physics TA for MITES**, MIT’s program for talented high school students from underrepresented backgrounds. It was a whirlwind of problem sets, whiteboard scribbles, late-night grading, and (most importantly) the kind of questions that make you pause, smile, and think: *“Wow, they really get it.”*

## What Stood Out

There were a few moments that made the experience unforgettable:

- **The Energy in the Room**: Even at 9 a.m., students were firing off questions about electromagnetism or projectile motion like it was a sport. Their curiosity set the tone.
- **Teaching Clicks**: Watching a student go from “this equation is nonsense” to “oh, that’s just conservation of momentum” was addicting.
- **Peer Connection**: A lot of my role was being the bridge between professor and student—someone approachable who could say, “yeah, I also thought that was confusing at first.”

## What I Learned

Being a TA wasn’t just about explaining physics—it was about learning how to **listen, adapt, and encourage**. Some students needed step-by-step breakdowns; others just wanted a nudge in the right direction. I came away with a deeper respect for good teaching and how much of it is about meeting people where they are.

In the end, MITES wasn’t just about students learning physics—it was about all of us, myself included, learning what it means to chase knowledge with excitement and persistence. And honestly, that’s the kind of lesson you can’t find in a textbook.
