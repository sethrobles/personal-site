This semester (Fall-2025), I am taking Robotic Manipulation, taught by Tomas Loranzo-Perez. This post will cover some of the topics covered and general processes involved with the class.

Most of the coding processes for the class are done on OneNote and assignments deal heavily with [Drake](https://drake.mit.edu/), the physics and robotics toolbox.







Below is a simulation made using an IIWA 7-DOF model to pick and place my initials.
