This summer I had the chance to serve as a residential **Physics TA for MITES**, MIT’s program for rising high school seniors from underrepresented backgrounds. The program lasted 6 weeks and presented an opportunity to grow as a teacher and mentor.

My coworker, Jan, and I led a group of 13 students for the summer as residential advisors, acting as mentors outside of our teaching duties. Together, we planned Boston outings, gropu activities, and organized check-ins with students throughout the summer.

There were a few moments that made the experience unforgettable:

- **Classrooms**: Recitations and lectures were moments of learning. Whether it was early or late, you could see the effort students put into understanding
- **Teaching Clicks**: Watching a student go from “this equation is nonsense” to “oh yeah, that's parabolic motion"
- **Peer Connection**: A lot of my role was being the bridge between professor and student—someone approachable who could say, “yeah, I also thought that was confusing at first.”

<h2 style="text-align:center;">What I Learned</h2>


Being a TA wasn’t just about explaining physics—it was about learning how to **listen, adapt, and encourage**. Some students needed step-by-step breakdowns; others just wanted a nudge in the right direction. I came away with a deeper respect for good teaching and how much of it is about meeting people where they are.

In the end, MITES wasn't just about teaching or learning physics. It was about mentoring younger students, helping them chase knowledge with excitment. It was about helping teach persistence in problem solving. It was about connecting with others, and learning that it's all about the Delta.
