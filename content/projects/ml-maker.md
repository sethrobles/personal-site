# ML Maker

ML Maker is a no-code machine learning toolkit designed to help users quickly analyze data, train models, and visualize resultsâ€”all from a simple web interface. Built for educators, students, and rapid prototypers, ML Maker streamlines the process of working with machine learning without requiring programming expertise.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**
  - Upload CSV datasets and explore statistics, distributions, and correlations interactively.
  - Visualize data with built-in charting tools.

- **Model Training**
  - Train regression and classification models using scikit-learn and PyTorch backends.
  - Advanced tuning options for hyperparameters and feature selection.

- **Model Deployment**
  - Save, load, and use trained models for predictions directly in the app.
  - Export models and metadata for use in other projects.

- **User Interface**
  - Intuitive web-based UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - Modular panels for data analysis, training, and visualization.

## Code Example

A simplified Python snippet for training a regression model with scikit-learn:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
y = data['target']

# Train model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X)
```
