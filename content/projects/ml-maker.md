ML Maker is a no-code machine learning toolkit built as an **Electron desktop application**. It’s designed to help users quickly analyze data, train models, and visualize results—all from a simple interface. Aimed at educators, students, and rapid prototypers, ML Maker streamlines the process of working with machine learning without requiring programming expertise. **The project is under active development.**

This project was built in collaboration with my friend **Jack**, whose contributions have been essential in shaping the design and development of ML Maker

<h2 style="text-align:center;">Key Features</h2>

- **Data Analysis**

    - Upload CSV datasets and explore statistics, distributions, and correlations interactively.
    - Visualize data with built-in charting tools.

- **Model Training**

    - Train regression and classification models using scikit-learn and PyTorch backends.
    - Advanced hyperparameter tuning and feature selection options.

- **Model Deployment**

    - Save, load, and use trained models for predictions directly in the app.
    - Export models and metadata for integration into other projects.

- **User Interface**

    - Cross-platform desktop app powered by Electron.
    - Modular, intuitive panels for data analysis, training, and visualization.

In the future, I hope that ML Maker encourages those with less technical expertise to familarize themselves with machine learning and its real-world applications.
