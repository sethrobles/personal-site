During my sophomore spring at MIT, I took **2.12: Introduction to Robotics**, taught by Professor Harry Asada. The class started with fundamentals—kinematics, electronics, and dynamics of robotic systems—and transitioned into machine learning and computer vision in the second half of the course.

The class concluded with two challenges: a mobile robot course and a **UR5 pick-and-place competition**. For my lab section, I was chosen as **Team Lead** for a group of 8 students working on the UR5 robot.

## Project Theme

The theme of our year was **plastic pollution clean-up**. The UR5 was tasked with detecting plastic bottles moving along a conveyor belt, classifying them with computer vision, and then sorting them into the correct bins—either through precise placement or even throwing.

## Features

- **Team Leadership**: Coordinated an 8-person team, assigning roles across perception, controls, and hardware integration.
- **Computer Vision**: Implemented detection and categorization of bottles using ML techniques.
- **Robotic Manipulation**: Programmed the UR5 to pick and place bottles from a moving conveyor belt.
- **Competition Performance**: Our system successfully identified and sorted plastics under timed competition conditions.
