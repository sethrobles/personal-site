I built **AccessPoint**, a website launched in March 2025, to centralize and streamline opportunities for underrepresented students. Rather than teaching modules, the focus was on creating a polished, service-oriented platform.

**Project Highlights**
1. **Full-stack development**
   - Built the backend in Flask with PostgreSQL for dynamic storage of scholarships, deadlines, and application data.
   - Designed the frontend with responsive HTML templates and a clean UI for browsing and filtering opportunities.
2. **Automation**
   - Implemented a system to check expiration status and application opening dates automatically.
   - Added tools for sorting and searching by eligibility, deadlines, and categories.
3. **Deployment**
   - Deployed the site with a production-ready configuration and integrated workflows for easy content updates.
4. **Impact**
   - Positioned as a resource hub for BIPOC, LGBTQ, and first-generation students seeking access to scholarships and educational programs.

Here’s an example of the dynamic “Opportunities” section:

After communicating with fellow founde rVincent, I realized that the project was providing insufficient value and we sunset the project.
