I built **AccessPoint**, a website launched in March 2025, to centralize and streamline opportunities for underrepresented students. The goal was to create a polished, service-oriented platform that made scholarships and educational programs easier to find and access.

<h2 style="text-align:center;">Key Features</h2>

1. **Full-stack development**
   - Developed the backend in Flask with PostgreSQL and integrated Supabase for authentication and data management.
   - Designed responsive HTML templates for the frontend, creating a clean UI for browsing and filtering opportunities.

2. **Automation**
   - Built a system to automatically check expiration status and application opening dates.
   - Added advanced search and filtering tools by eligibility, deadlines, and categories.

3. **Deployment**
   - Deployed with a production-ready configuration and integrated workflows to streamline content updates.

4. **Impact**
   - Created a centralized resource hub supporting BIPOC, LGBTQ, and first-generation students in accessing scholarships and educational programs.

<h2 style="text-align:center;">What I Learned</h2>

Working on AccessPoint taught me the importance of validating product-market fit early. Although the technical foundation was strong, conversations with my co-founder, Vincent, revealed that the platform wasn’t delivering enough value to our intended users. From this, I learned:

- How to scope and build a full-stack web platform with Flask, PostgreSQL, and Supabase.
- How to implement automated systems for time-sensitive data (deadlines, expirations, openings).
- How to structure deployments with long-term maintainability in mind.
- That even strong technical execution must be matched with real user needs for a project to succeed.

Ultimately, we sunset the project — but the lessons around both technical development and entrepreneurial validation continue to shape how I approach future work.
