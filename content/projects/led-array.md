This is an red LED array (32x32) design in KiCAD and will eventually ordered from JLCPCB. It is a 4-layer PCB board is using a STM32 controller, 16 shift regiseters, and 8 N-fets. **The project is under active development, and new features are being added frequently.**

Thank you to my friend Miguel for providing a lot of guidance on this project.
