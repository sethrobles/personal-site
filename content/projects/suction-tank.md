# Suction Tank Robot

This project was my attempt to create a **tank-style robot that climbs and holds position using suction**. The idea was to prototype a platform that could traverse surfaces where wheels or tracks alone wouldn’t provide enough grip.

## Features

- **Tank Drive**: Independent tracks for maneuverability.
- **Suction Chamber**: Designed a sealed cavity beneath the chassis to generate suction and hold the robot against flat surfaces.
- **3D Printed Frame**: Fully FDM-printed parts, optimized for modularity and quick reprints.
- **Compact Motor Integration**: Small DC motors fitted into custom housings to drive the tracks.

## Prototyping Process

I went through several design iterations in CAD before printing a working prototype:

1. **Frame & Tracks** – Modeled tank treads with integrated sprockets for better traction.
2. **Suction System** – Experimented with gasket materials and chamber size to maximize holding force.
3. **Assembly** – Printed parts on an FDM printer and tested modular swaps for track tensioning and suction seals.

Here’s an early chassis prototype:

## Challenges

- Maintaining suction while allowing movement.
- Designing a frame that could house motors, a vacuum pump, and the seal without being bulky.
- Balancing weight so the robot could stay adhered without sacrificing mobility.

## Future Plans

- [ ] Integrate sensors for wall/ceiling navigation.
- [ ] Add wireless control and telemetry.
- [ ] Refine suction seals for better efficiency.
- [ ] Explore soft robotics-inspired adhesion techniques.

This project combined **mechanical prototyping, CAD iteration, and hands-on testing**. While still in its early stages, the suction tank robot gave me valuable insight into designing for unconventional mobility systems.
